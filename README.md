#Carrot Framework

Readme is going to be worked on later. Currently on version 0.0.2, I guess!

Not even finished yet and will be working on this for a while and implementing/tidying things.

Just half a days work but saving it on Github.

Also I use Apache on my local machine but I intend on using Nginx in production

Database wrapper thing done now and so are a few bash scripts, so I have made a new todo:

##Todo

* Tidy Code
* Think of a few more good scripts that might be needed
* Write some documentation
* Prepare a release setup?
* Relating to above: Write a setup script?
