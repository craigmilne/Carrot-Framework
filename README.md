#Carrot Framework

Readme is going to be worked on later. Currently on version 0.0.1, I guess?

Not even finished yet and will be working on this for a while and implementing/tidying things.

Just half a days work but saving it on Github.

Also I use Apache on my local machine but I intend on using Nginx in production

##Todo

* Database implementation/wrapper
* Auto create controllers/views etc.
* Auto delete them
* Tidy code
